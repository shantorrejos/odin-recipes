        <p> Learn how to marinate shrimp for grilling with this
             easy marinade that makes your shrimp so yummy you 
             don't even need cocktail sauce. Don't let the 
             cayenne pepper scare you â€” you don't even taste 
             it. My young kids love it. It is also a big hit 
             with company and easy to prepare. I make this 
             with frozen or fresh shrimp and use my indoor 
             electric grill if the weather is not good for 
             outdoor grilling. Try it with a salad, baked 
             potato, and garlic bread.</p>
